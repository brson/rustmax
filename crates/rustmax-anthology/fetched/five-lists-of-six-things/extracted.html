<div class="entry-content"><i><small>I don't often give talks about Rust, but I was in Tokyo recently during the Rust 1.0 release and figured I'd drop in on the Mozilla Tokyo office release party. I figured they'd try to make me talk about something, so I prepared a lightning talk. As is typical of my Rust-project communication style, I presented in point form. This is the contents of the talk:</small></i><br><br><h2>Five lists of six things about Rust:</h2><br><ol><br><li>Six ways Rust is fundamentally different from how it started<br><ol><br><li>Borrow checker subsumed most other safety mechanisms, lots discarded<br></li><li>Much more static: monomorphization of sizes, glue code, and static trait dispatch<br></li><li>LLVM: strengths (amazing optimization) and weaknesses (narrow semantics)<br></li><li>Between these two points, maybe 100x faster at runtime, 100x slower to compile<br></li><li>Grammar, resolution, dispatch, type system much more complex, expressive<br></li><li>Adopted standard C platform stack, threads, ABI, linkage, mangling, unwinding<br></li></ol><br></li><li>Six ways Rust is fundamentally the same as how it started<br><ol><br><li>Safety through memory ownership and isolation, no global GC, no aliased mutable state<br></li><li>Default immutable, algebraic data types ("ML in C++ clothing")<br></li><li>Focus on dense memory layout, interior allocation, minimizing pointer chasing, vectors over lists<br></li><li>No global namespace, everything module scoped and crate relative<br></li><li>Support for standard tools: gdb, perf, dtrace, objdump<br></li><li>RAII, dtors, idempotent uncatchable unwinding ("crash only")<br></li></ol><br></li><li>Six things we lost along the way<br><ol><br><li>Typestate system<br></li><li>Effect system<br></li><li>Function complexities: parameter modes, argument binding, stack iterators, tail calls<br></li><li>Language-integrated runtime for tasks, channels, logging<br></li><li>GC pointers, task local GC (yes, rustboot had a real mark/sweep)<br></li><li>Dynamic, structural object types<br></li></ol><br></li><li>Six things we gained along the way<br><ol><br><li>Lambdas, with environment capture<br></li><li>First class borrowed pointers -- not just parameter modes -- with explicit lifetimes<br></li><li>Traits, with associated items<br></li><li>Hygienic macros beyond just raw syntax extensions<br></li><li>Multiple parallelism modes beyond just actors (ARC, fork/join, SIMD)<br></li><li>Cargo, crates.io, a huge vibrant community!<br></li></ol><br></li><li>Six things I'm irrationally, disproportionately pleased by<br><ol><br><li>Rich patterns: slice patterns, range patterns, or patterns<br></li><li>Novel consequences of move semantics: static freeze/thaw, iterators that consume their containers<br></li><li>Rich syntax extensions: compile time regular expressions, SQL statements, docopt<br></li><li>Novel embeddings: postgres and python extensions, crypto libraries, kernels in rust<br></li><li>C++ ballpark on benchmarks<br></li><li>A 1.0 stable release after nearly a decade of work<br></li></ol><br></li><br><br><i><small>(Ok, maybe my pleasure at some of these is rational and proportionate..)</small></i></ol></div>
