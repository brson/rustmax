# Ecosystem features

`rustmax` identifies Cargo features common across many crates.


## ⛲ Feature: `rmx-feature-no-std`

This feature is enabled by [`rmx-profile-no-std`].
It does not typically need to be set manually.

It enables few features,
particularly enabling allocator support for no-std crates
that can be compiled without.


## ⛲ Feature: `rmx-feature-std`

This feature is enabled by [`rmx-profile-std`].
It does not typically need to be set manually.

It enables the "std" feature of crates
and other default features that require the standard library.


## ⛲ Feature: `rmx-feature-std-portable`

This feature is enabled by [`rmx-profile-portable`].
It does not typically need to be set manually.

Similar to [`rmx-feature-std`], but excludes features
that are incompatible with portable targets (WASM, musl cross-compilation),
such as those requiring threading or OS-specific APIs.


## ⛲ Feature: `rmx-feature-default`

This feature is enabled by [`rmx-profile-std`].
It does not typically need to be set manually.

It enables the "default" feature of crates.


## ⛲ Feature: `rmx-feature-default-portable`

This feature is enabled by [`rmx-profile-portable`].
It does not typically need to be set manually.

Similar to [`rmx-feature-default`], but uses portable
default features where necessary (e.g., excludes zstd from zip).


## ⛲ Feature: `rmx-feature-more`

This feature is enabled by [`rmx-profile-std`].
It does not typically need to be set manually.

This activates extra crate features for convenience
that the crates themselves do not typically activate by default.


## ⛲ Feature: `rmx-feature-more-portable`

This feature is enabled by [`rmx-profile-portable`].
It does not typically need to be set manually.

Similar to [`rmx-feature-more`], but excludes features
that are incompatible with portable targets,
such as blocking I/O and threading.


## ⛲ Feature: `rmx-feature-derive`

Enables derive macros of crates where it is optional,
typically with a feature named "derive".


## ⛲ Feature: `rmx-feature-serde`

Enables [`serde`] support for crates where it is optional,
typically with a feature named "serde".


## ⛲ Feature: `rmx-feature-backtrace`

Enables backtrace support for crates where it is optional,
typically with a feature named "backtrace".

This feature is necessary for backtrace support in [`anyhow`].

This feature also enables `rmx-feature-std`.


## ⛲ Feature: `rmx-feature-tokio`

Enables [`tokio`] support for crates where it is optional,
typically with a feature named "tokio".


## ⛲Feature: `rmx-feature-nightly`

Enables features that only compile with the Rust [nightly compiler],
typically with a feature named "nightly".




# Rust standard libraries

`rustmax` re-exports the standard Rust libraries for convenience.
These features enable reexports of the corresponding standard library crates
as modules within `rustmax`.


## 📙 Rustlib: `rmx-rustlib-core`

Reexports the [`core`] library.
Enabled by [`rmx-profile-no-std`] and all profiles that include it.


## 📙 Rustlib: `rmx-rustlib-alloc`

Reexports the [`alloc`] library.
Enabled by [`rmx-profile-no-std`] and all profiles that include it.


## 📙 Rustlib: `rmx-rustlib-std`

Reexports the [`std`] library.
Enabled by [`rmx-profile-std`] and all profiles that include it.


## 📙 Rustlib: `rmx-rustlib-proc_macro`

Reexports the [`proc_macro`] library.
Enabled by [`rmx-profile-proc-macro`].




# Using `rustmax` as a library.

In your manifest `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rmx.package = "rustmax"
rmx.version = "0.0.7"
rmx.features = [
  "rmx-profile-portable",
]
```

Or if using a workspace, in your workspace `Cargo.toml`

```toml
[dependencies]
rmx.version = "0.0.7"
rmx.features = [
  "rmx-profile-portable",
]
```

And in your crate's `Cargo.toml`

```toml
[dependencies]
rmx.workspace = true
```




## `rustmax` and cargo features

todo

The main way of configuring the `rustmax` crates is by enabling
the appropriate _profile_ cargo features.

`rustmax` enables no features by default,
and reexports no crates;
but for most uses people will want to enable [`rmx-profile-std`].
This feature augments the Rust `std` library with crates
that are widely used with a variety of Rust programs,
as well as minor helpers missing from the standard library.

```toml
[dependencies]
rmx.package = "rustmax"
rmx.version = "0.0.7"
rmx.features = [
  "rmx-profile-portable",
]
```




## Crate reexports

The crates of `rustmax` are all reexported as modules from the `rustmax` crate.

```rust,ignore
# use rustmax as rmx;
use rmx::rand::Rng;
```

These modules should generally behave the same as the corresponding crates,
with exceptions noted in ["Known Bugs"](#known-bugs).
These modules have have `rustmax`-specific module-level documentation,
with a short description and motivation, an example,
and relevant links, including to the original crate-level documentation.

These modules are only defined when their crate is configured
through cargo features like `rmx-profile-std`.




## The `rustmax` prelude




## The `extras` module




## Known bugs

- `serde` derive only works if the `serde` crate is an explicit dependency.
- `derive_more` derives only works if the `derive_more` crate is an explicit dependency.
