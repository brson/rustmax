This is a sub-project to develop a companion app to Rustmax.

My requirements are that it maximally demonstrate the use
of Rustmax APIs.

Your requirements are to make an meaningful and useful,
production quality, application. You will design and develop the whole thing,
and should write and commit your own development documentation
to keep track of your roadmap and progress.
You have complete freedom to make all decisions;
I will only check in to ensure you are meeting my requirements.
