# Rust Extra

A collection of useful Rust crates and tools.


## The `rustx` crate

The only thing here presently is the `rustx` crate,
which documents and reexports selected high-quality
Rust crates for typical Rust usage.
It can be thought of as a "batteries-included" standard library.

[Documentation](https://docs.rs/rustx).

**This project is not open to contribution at this time.
Pull requests adding crates are not welcome and will be closed.**


## License

`rustx` is licensed Apache-2.0 OR CC0-1.0 OR MIT.

All libraries included as dependencies of the `rustx` crate
are permissively licensed under Apache-2.0 or weaker (e.g. MIT).
