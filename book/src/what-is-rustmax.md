# What is Rustmax?

_Rustmax_ is a collection of crates, tools, and documentation
for the Rust programming language.

_Rust_ is a modern systems programming language
that is extremely fast and does not crash.
It is suitable for development of high-performance, low-level software
as in operating systems, databases, and distributed systems;
as well as command-line, web, mobile, embedded, and application development.

_Rustmax_ is a comprehensive guide to the Rust ecosystem
for new and old Rust programmers,
including a "batteries-included" supercrate
of selected high-quality Rust libraries:
<a href="../api/rustmax/index.html"><code>rustmax</code></a>.

> Rustmax is not an official Rust project.
