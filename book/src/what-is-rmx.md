# What is Rust Max?

Rust Max,
also known by its crate name `rmx`,
is a collection of crates, tools, and documentation
for the Rust programming language.

Rust is a modern systems programming language
that is extremely fast and does not crash.
It is suitable for development of high-performance, low-level software
as in operating systems, databases, and distributed systems;
as well as cli, web, device, and application development.

Rust Max is a comprehensive guide to the Rust ecosystem
for new and old Rust programmers,
including a "batteries-included" supercrate
of selected high-quality Rust libraries:
[`rmx`](todo).

> Rust Max is not an official Rust project.
