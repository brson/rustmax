# Task: improve one book section

This project is rustmax,
a learning tool for rust users
derived from my expert experience.

We're working on the rustmax book,
in book/, with text in book/src.

The book has many chapters
and sections sketched out but
is incomplete.

Pick one section of one markdown
file in book/src and improve it.

The best text will be concise,
and impart "tribal knowledge"
about rust that will be non-obvious to new users.
