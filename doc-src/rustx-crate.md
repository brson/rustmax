## Profiles

todo

By default no profile is enabled and no crates are exported.




## üåé Profile: `rx-profile-no-std`

This profile includes crates that do not require Rust `std`.
It allows use of the Rust allocator,
and enables allocator-related features of its crates.

üí° This profile also enables [`rx-feature-no-std`].\
üí° This profile also enables [`rx-rustlibs-no-std`].\

- [`serde`]
- [`serde_json`]
- [`static_assertions`]
- [`toml`]




## üåé Profile: `rx-profile-std`

This profile depends on the Rust standard library,
and includes crates that require the Rust standard library,
in addition to the crates provided by [`rx-profile-no-std`].

üí° This profile also enables [`rx-feature-std`].\
üí° This profile also enables [`rx-feature-default`].\
üí° This profile also enables [`rx-rustlibs-std`].\


### Crates in `rx-profile-std`

- [`big_s`]

- [`walkdir`]
- [`xshell`]




## üåé Profile: `rx-profile-net`

Adds networking crates,
including the [`tokio`] async runtime.

Not that this profile does not enable `tokio` features
for other crates; to enable `tokio` features
apply the [`rx-feature-tokio`] feature.

üí° This profile also enables [`rx-profile-std`].\


### Crates in `rx-profile-net`

- [`http`]
- [`hyper`]
- [`mime`]
- [`reqwest`]
- [`socket2`]
- [`tokio`]
- [`url`]




## üåé Profile: `rx-profile-cli`

### Crates in `rx-profile-cli`

- [`console`]
- [`dialoguer`]
- [`indicatif`]
- [`termcolor`]
- [`rustyline`]




## üåé Profile: `rx-profile-build-script`

Crates for writing [Rust build scripts](todo).

üí° This profile also enables [`rx-profile-std`].\


### Crates in `rx-profile-build-script`

- [`cc`]
- [`cxx`]
- [`cxx-build`](cxx_build)




## üåé Profile: `rx-profile-proc-macro`

Crates for writing [Rust procedural macros](todo).

üí° This profile also enables [`rx-profile-std`].\


### Crates in `rx-profile-proc-macro`

- [`proc-macro2`](proc_macro2)
- [`quote`]
- [`syn`]




## üåé Profile: `rx-profile-full`

This profile simply enables all other profiles.




# Using `rustx` as a library.

The `rustx` crate name is `rstx`,
but it is usually renamed `rx` in your Cargo manifest,
since the crate name will be typed often.

In your manifest `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rx.package = "rstx"
rx.version = "0.1.0"
rx.features = [
  "rx-profile-std",
]
```

Or if using a workspace, in your workspace `Cargo.toml`

```toml
[dependencies]
rx.package = "rstx"
rx.version = "0.1.0"
rx.features = [
  "rx-profile-std",
]
```

And in your manifest `Cargo.toml`

```toml
[dependencies]
rx.workspace = true
```




# `rustx` and cargo features

todo

The main way of configuring the `rustx` crates is by enabling
the appropriate _profile_ cargo features.

`rustx` enables no features by default,
and reexports no crates;
but for most uses people will want to enable [`rx-profile-std`].
This feature augments the Rust `std` library with crates
that are widely used with a variety of Rust programs,
as well as minor helpers missing from the standard library.

```toml
[dependencies]
rx.package = "rstx"
rx.version = "0.1.0"
rx.features = ["rx-profile-std"]
```

## Feature: `rx-feature-no-std`

This feature is enabled by [`rx-profile-no-std`].
It does not typically need to be set manually.

It enables few features,
particularly enabling allocator support for no-std crates
that can be compiled without.


## Feature: `rx-feature-std`

This feature is enabled by [`rx-profile-std`].
It does not typically need to be set manually.

It enables the "std" feature of crates
and other default features that require the standard library.


## Feature: `rx-feature-default`

This feature is enabled by [`rx-profile-std`].
It does not typically need to be set manually.

It enables the "default" feature of crates.


## Feature: `rx-feature-derive`

Enables derive macros of crates where it is optional,
typically with a feature named "derive".


## Feature: `rx-feature-serde`

Enables [`serde`] support for crates where it is optional,
typically with a feature named "serde".


## Feature: `rx-feature-backtrace`

Enables backtrace support for crates where it is optional,
typically with a feature named "backtrace".

This feature is necessary for backtrace support in [`anyhow`].

This feature also enables `rx-feature-std`.


## Feature: `rx-feature-tokio`

Enables [`tokio`] support for crates where it is optional,
typically with a feature named "tokio".


## Feature: `rx-feature-nightly`

Enables features that only compile with the Rust [nightly compiler],
typically with a feature named "nightly".
