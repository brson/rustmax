Rustmax 0.0.6 is released with 289 commits since 0.0.5.


## Highlights

**WASM profile** - New `rmx-profile-wasm` feature enables a curated subset of crates compatible with WebAssembly targets.
This is a nice baseline to use for projects that need wide platform compatibility, but more than just no-std.

**Powerletters in prelude** - The [powerletters](https://crates.io/crates/powerletters)
are now in their own crate and reexported.
See the blog post, [Powerletters for Rust](https://brson.github.io/2025/10/07/powerletters-for-rust).

**Anthology** - A new curated collection of classic Rust blog posts and articles, including "Abstraction Without Overhead", "Peeking Inside Trait Objects", and more.
These subsume [rust-anthology](https://github.com/brson/rust-anthology).
A nascent project, not yet published to the website.


## New crates

- **flate2** - DEFLATE compression/decompression
- **glob** - Unix shell-style pattern matching


## Breaking changes

- Removed `byteorder` crate (use `{integer}::from_le_bytes` and friends instead)
