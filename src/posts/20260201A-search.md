I've added the barest of search functionality.

The idea with Rustmax search is that is will be curated
with topics related to Rustmax: crates, books and their chapters,
standard library modules.
Definitely not a full-text search like rustdoc;
need to keep the index small.

Right now it only searches crates, books and standard library modules,
by name or aliases.

I'll expand this basic search to be a bit more rich and robust
with curated keywords etc;
then augment it with things like function names, types, etc.
