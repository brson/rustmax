summary: "Adding hint-mostly-unused, etc."

Rustmax 0.0.8 is released with 73 commits since 0.0.7.

No new crates.
Mostly releasing this to test [`hint-mostly-unused`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/unstable.html#profile-hint-mostly-unused-option).

Since the previous release I've switched the API rendering
to a custom rustdoc renderer.
Now the website shares a consistent style between
books, rustdocs, and website pages.

## Graveyard additions

- `memoffset` - Superseded by `std::mem::offset_of!`
