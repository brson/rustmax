Rustmax 0.0.7 is released with 72 commits since 0.0.6.


## New crates

Working on the backlog.
These are all crates that I either
use regularly or are the obvious
crate for a common feature.

- **blake3** - Fast cryptographic hashing
- **comrak** - CommonMark / GitHub-flavored Markdown parser
- **crossbeam** - Concurrent programming utilities
- **ignore** - Gitignore-style pattern matching
- **image** - Image processing
- **indicatif** - Terminal progress bars and spinners
- **memchr** - Fast byte searching
- **mime** - MIME types
- **notify** - File system notifications
- **proptest** - Property-based testing
- **url** - URL parsing
- **zip** - ZIP archive handling


## Removed crates

- Removed `backtrace` crate (use `std::backtrace` instead)
- Removed `num_cpus` crate (use `std::thread::available_parallelism` instead)
- Removed `static_assertions` crate


## Other changes

**`rustmax new-project` command** -
The CLI now supports scaffolding new projects configured for rustmax.
This is basically the same as running `cargo-generate brson/rustmax`.

**Custom book renderer** -
Replaced mdbook with a custom `rmxbook` renderer for documentation.
This avoids `mdbook` version and plugin incompatibilites,
as well as sidesteps all book-specific restyling issues:
we just render every book however we want to,
in a consistent style.
Still needs lots of love to handle book-specific and plugin-related issues.

**Faster Rustmax doctests** -
Rustmax now uses a custom test harness to test
its crate examples.
It's much faster than rustdoc for faster development.

**WebSocket support** -
Axum WebSocket support is now enabled by default.


## Other changes

- Upgraded `json5`, `reqwest`, and `rustyline` to latest major versions
- Fixed deprecated APIs in doc examples
