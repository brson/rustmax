This directory is for The Rustmax Suite,
an integration test for the crates of Rustmax.

It is designed and mantained by Claude.

It is a single large-scale application that integrates
all crates from rustmax in order to exercise them together.

The application design details do not matter -
what matters is that the crates can be exercised and their coverage measured.
The application behavior can even be nonsense if that is useful.
