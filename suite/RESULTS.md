# Suite Coverage Results

## Summary

Created comprehensive dependency coverage tests across two rounds.

## Round 1: `tests/dependency_coverage.rs`

23 tests covering:
- Core utilities: serde_json, itertools
- Crypto/hashing: blake3, sha2, base64, hex
- Date/time: chrono, jiff
- Text processing: regex, unicode-segmentation
- Error handling: anyhow
- Data structures: bytes, bitflags, byteorder
- I/O: tempfile, walkdir
- Random: rand, rand_chacha
- CLI: log
- URL: url
- Config: toml
- Concurrency: crossbeam
- Versioning: semver

## Initial Coverage Improvements

Sample run (5 dependencies) showed:
- ahash: 16.93% (unchanged from baseline)
- anyhow: 0% → 23.15% ✓
- axum: 0%
- backtrace: 0%
- base64: 0% → 22.00% ✓

## Round 2: `tests/dependency_coverage_round2.rs`

11 additional tests targeting:
- Rayon: Parallel iteration, sorting, find operations
- Proptest: Property-based testing with strategies
- Nom: Parser combinators
- Num-bigint: Big integer arithmetic
- Tera: Template engine
- Xshell: Shell command execution
- Termcolor: Colored terminal output
- Env_logger: Logger initialization

Note: Serde and Clap tests were skipped due to re-export complexities.

## Total Test Count

34 tests (23 from round1 + 11 from round2)

## Next Steps

1. Run full coverage collection: `./collect-dep-coverage.sh` (takes ~10min for all 63 deps)
2. Analyze round2 improvements: rayon, proptest, nom, tera, etc.
3. Focus on async stack: tokio, reqwest, hyper, axum (requires async runtime setup)
4. Add more specialized tests for deps still at 0%
5. Consider async/web integration when suite's async binaries are re-enabled

## Notes

- All 23 tests pass successfully
- Tests compile cleanly with Rust 2024 edition
- Uses new rand API (`random()` instead of deprecated `gen()`)
- Coverage collection script works correctly with new tests
