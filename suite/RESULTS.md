# Suite Coverage Results

## Summary

Created comprehensive dependency coverage tests that exercise rustmax dependencies.

## Test File

`tests/dependency_coverage.rs` - 23 tests covering:
- Core utilities: serde_json, itertools
- Crypto/hashing: blake3, sha2, base64, hex
- Date/time: chrono, jiff
- Text processing: regex, unicode-segmentation
- Error handling: anyhow
- Data structures: bytes, bitflags, byteorder
- I/O: tempfile, walkdir
- Random: rand, rand_chacha
- CLI: log
- URL: url
- Config: toml
- Concurrency: crossbeam
- Versioning: semver

## Initial Coverage Improvements

Sample run (5 dependencies) showed:
- ahash: 16.93% (unchanged from baseline)
- anyhow: 0% → 23.15% ✓
- axum: 0%
- backtrace: 0%
- base64: 0% → 22.00% ✓

## Next Steps

1. Run full coverage collection: `./collect-dep-coverage.sh`
2. Analyze which dependencies still have 0% coverage
3. Add more tests for uncovered dependencies
4. Focus on higher-value dependencies (tokio, reqwest, hyper for web stack)
5. Consider adding async/web tests when async binaries are re-enabled

## Notes

- All 23 tests pass successfully
- Tests compile cleanly with Rust 2024 edition
- Uses new rand API (`random()` instead of deprecated `gen()`)
- Coverage collection script works correctly with new tests
